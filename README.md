**_Lines of Play_ is a domino AR experiment built with Unity highlighting recent advancements in [ARCore](https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-unity-sdk). Unlike previous mobile AR applications limited to horizontal and vertical object placement, AR Core's [__Depth API__](https://developers.googleblog.com/2019/12/blending-realities-with-arcore-depth-api.html) allows game objects to interact with real objects in the player’s environment with near surface-level resolution.**

Features of the player’s environment provide  constraints (*on __collision__*) and serve as visual obstructions (*__occlusion__*). Players can use *Lines of Play* to rapidly create and modify lines, rings, paths, and turns of domino tiles.

This app was developed in the Unity Editor and written in C# using the MonoDevelop framework and using ARFoundation. ARFoundation allows build to target both capable iOS and Android devices.

## What is the Depth API?
<a name="intro"></a>

The ARCore Depth API enables depth map creation using a single camera without the use of peripheral hardware. The source gets different references to keep the depth textures up to date, retrieves focal length in pixels and transforms a camera-space vertex into world space.

A depth map is created by taking multiple images from different angles and comparing them as phone is moved and estimating the distance to every pixel. This depth-map determines which objects are closer to the player and thus whether a virtual object placed in the environment should appear overlapped by a real-world object.



## Building the Project in Unity
<a name="project"></a>

[Download the Unity Editor](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) (this application was developed using 2018.4 (LTS)\
**_Note:_**  If this is your first time using the Unity Editor, install the Unity Hub

### For Android
1. Before building and running the app, ensure [AR is enabled](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.core&hl=en) on your device.
2. During download, install `Android Build Support`.
3. Install `Android SDK & NDK` Tools and `Open JDK`.
4. Download or clone this repository
5. Add project in Unity Hubs and open project
6. In Files ▸ Build Settings, Switch build target from `PC, Mac and Linux Standalone` to `Android`
7. Navigate to Edit ▸ Project Settings ▸ Player ▸ Other Settings
* Turn off `Multithreaded Rendering`
* Change color space from `Gamma` to `Linear`
* Turn off `Autographics API`
* Enable `Open GLES3`
* Set to minimum API level to `Android 9.0 (Pie)` API level 24 or higher
* Set unique names for *Product Name* and *Package Name*
8. In Player ▸ XR Settings check `ARCore supported`
9. Connect device and allow for USB debugging
10. Navigate to File ▸ Build Settings, make sure `Scene/MainScene` is checked in *Scenes in Build* queue
11. `Build and Run` application.

### For iOS
1. During download, install `iOS Build Support`.
2. Download or clone this repository
3. Add project in Unity Hubs and open project

## Using the Placement Tools
<a name="tools"></a>

After application start, once scene has been scanned, a phantom domino tile is raycast onto the ground plane to provide a preview of where the domino will appear when the user taps the screen. Players can place multiple domino tiles using this method or can toggle between pre- defined path placement modes in the application’s interface.

There are five different modes of domino path placement:

- **Single placement** - Players can tap to place individual domino tiles *(as previously mentioned)*
- **Line placement** - Players can draw a path by specifying two points A and B and generate a line of dominoes
- **Circle placement** - Players can generate a ring of dominoes by specifying a center point of the circle and a point on its circumference
- **Square placement** - Player can specify two points A and B, that comprise the diagonal of a square. This is referred to as a 90-degree turn
- **Draw to place** - Players can freeform draw on surfaces and a path of equidistant dominos will generate


## General Notes
<a name="general-notes"></a>

* For the Depth API to work, the *user needs to move their phone for a few seconds* before occlusion starts working reliably

* *Optimal range is 1-3 meters* (near and far depth estimates are less accurate)

* *Dynamic objects do not immediately occlude*. This adjusts when the scene becomes static
